# circumplanetary_disks

This repository is used to simulate circumplanetary disks in any geometry (inclination, tilt, impact parameter) with azimuthally symmetric rings (radii and opacities), with any size star (diameter).

It also includes code to take existing light curves and, by defining a few parameters, explore the phase space of disks above providing possible orientations, sizes and optical thicknesses of disks that could produce such a light curve.
